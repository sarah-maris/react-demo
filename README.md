# React Demo project

This project is designed as a playground for React learners.

## How to Load the App in Development Mode

The project uses Node.js and the Create-React-App starter. If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app

```
git clone https://github.com/sarah-maris/react-demo.git
npm install
```

Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the app with

```
npm start
```

Alternatively, you can use Yarn:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app. If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser
